\subsection{Symbol definition}
This article considers a shared memory system.
The system is modeled as $m$ processors and a task set $\Gamma = \{\tau_0, \tau_1, ..., \tau_{n-1} \}$. \\
Each task $\tau_i$ is characterized by its worst-case execution time $C_i$ and its period $T_i$, both of which are assumed to be integer multiples of a system unit time.
We consider real-time tasks with implicit deadlines.
That is, $T_i$ is also the relative deadline of task $\tau_i$.
The weight for task $\tau_i$ is defined as $W_i = \dfrac{C_i}{T_i}$, and the system utilization is $U_\Gamma = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} W_i$.
We assume that $0 < W_i < 1$, and $0 < U_\Gamma < m$. \\
A job $J_{i,j}$ is the $j$th task instance of task $\tau_i$. It arrives at time $JStart_{i,j} = j \cdot T_i$ and need to complete its execution by its deadline at time $JEnd_{i,j} = (j+1) \cdot T_i$.
Assuming that the first job of each task arrives at time 0.
That is, $\forall \tau_i \in \Gamma, JStart_{i,0} = 0$.  \\
The multiprocessor real-time scheduling problem is to construct a peroidc schedule for the above tasks, which allocates exactly $C_i$ time units of a processor to task $\tau_i$ within each interval $[(k-1) \cdot T_i, k \cdot T_i)$ for all $k \in \{1,2,3,...\}$, subject to the following constraints:
\begin{compactitem}
\item C1: A processor can only be allocated to one task at any time, that is, processors cannot be shared concurrently;
\item C2: A task can only be allocated at most one processor at any time, that is, tasks are not parallel and thus cannot occupy more than one processor at any time.
\end{compactitem}
The least common multiple of all tasks' period is $H_\Gamma$.
Because of the periodic property of the problem, we only consider the schedule from time 0 to time $H_\Gamma$.
We split the time range $[0, H_\Gamma)$ into $znum$ zones with consecutive deadlines.
Each zone $Z_i$ start at time $ZStart_i$ and end at time $ZEnd_i$.
$\forall c, \exists (i,j), ZStart_c = j \cdot T_i, ZStart_c < ZEnd_c$ and $ZEnd_c = ZStart_{c+1}$($c = 0,...,znum-2$). \\
The scheduling during $[0, H_\Gamma)$ is expressed by a matrix $M$ with $n$ rows and $znum$ columns.
Elements in M denoted as $alloc_{i,j}$ represents the execution time units assigned to $\tau_i$ in $Z_j$.
The scheduling matrix only specifies the assigned units amount, without concerning the exact time and processor a task is to execute.\\

\subsection{Overload effect}
\begin{defi}
The minimum load of $\tau_i$ in $Z_k$ is the minimum units of execution time that must be assigned to $\tau_i$ in $Z_k$ to meet the deadline.
\[
	Lt_{i,k}=MAX(0,ZWidth_k-L_{i,k})
\]
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
The maximum load of $\tau_i$ in $Z_k$ is the maximum units of execution time that can be assigned to $\tau_i$ in $Z_k$ considering the WCET of a job and the width of a Zone(to ensure a task can only be executed in a processor at a time).
\[
	Mt_{i,k}=MIN(R_{i,k}, ZWidth_k)
\]
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
The execution assignment is \textbf{rational} in $Z_k$ if execution time assigned to each task is between minimum load and maximum load, and the sum of execution time of tasks in $\Gamma$ doesn't exceed the capacity of $Z_k$.
\[
	\forall i \in [0,n) : Lt_{i,k} \leq alloc_{i,k} \leq Mt_{i,k}
\]
\[
	\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}alloc_{i,k} \leq m \cdot ZWidth_k
\]
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
\textbf{Overload effect} occurs if the total minimum load of tasks in $\Gamma$ is more than the capacity of $Z_k$.
\[
	\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}Lt_{i,k} > m \cdot ZWidth_k
\]
\end{defi}
